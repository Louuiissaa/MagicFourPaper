  abstract = {Prototypes are widely recognized to be a core means of exploring and expressing designs for interactive computer artifacts. Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use. Current terminology for describing prototypes centers on attributes of prototypes themselves that can be distracting. Tools can be used in many different ways, and detail is not a sure indicator of completion. This chapter proposes a change in the language used to talk about prototypes, to focus more on fundamental questions about the interactive system being designed. The goal of this chapter is to establish a model that describes any prototype in terms of the artifact being designed rather than the prototype's incidental attributes. By focusing on the purpose of the prototype\textemdash{}that is, what it prototypes\textemdash{}better decisions can be made about the kinds of prototypes to build. With a clear purpose for each prototype, prototypes can be better used to think and communicate about design. This chapter begins by describing current difficulties in communicating about prototypes: the complexity of interactive systems; issues of multi-disciplinary teamwork; and the audiences of prototypes. The chapter introduces the model and illustrates it with some initial examples of prototypes from real projects. The chapter concludes with a summary of the main implications of the model for prototyping practice.},

  abstract = {Screen mirroring has been available to consumers for some time, however if every mobile device in the room supports screen mirroring to the main display (e.g. a shared TV), this necessitates a mechanism for managing its use. As such, this paper investigates allowing users in small intimacy groups (friends, family etc.) to self-manage mirrored use of the display, through passing/taking/requesting the display from whomever is currently mirroring to it. We examine the collaborative benefits this scheme could provide for the home, compared to existing multi-device use and existing screen mirroring implementations. Results indicate shared screen mirroring improves perceived collaboration, decreases dominance, preserves independence and has a positive effect on a group's activity awareness.},

  abstract = {Our lifestyle has evolved in such a way that optimizing time is the most important thing. Based on the user studies and prototype implementation, we present the development of an innovating appliance that incorporates interactive services of information, offered through a user interface on the surface of a mirror. Our work is based on the idea that we all looks at the mirror when we go out, so why wouldn't the mirror become smart. The framework will offer basic services, like the presentation of personalized weather data, time, date and will incorporate some additional functionality, like reminder service by mobile synchronization and through social media. Our framework is based on detecting presence of human using Passive Infrared sensors and Wi-Fi connectivity. Once a person comes in front of the mirror, it displays the information that is being fed from the web. This data or information includes calendar, time, weather, news feed, notifications and so on. Our framework also discusses about the speech recognition and its application in control mechanism in home appliances and opening and closing of shelf. We use speech recognition to automate many tasks that usually requires hands-on human interaction, such as recognizing spoken commands to perform something like turning on lights or shutting a door. Our framework also introduces speech activated music player, and plays the music when a person gives a command.},

  abstract = {Cognitive care for the elderly can be provided by training their cognitive skills in order to reduce age-related decline of cognitive capabilities. This is typically achieved with cognitive games that can benefit from computer interfaces. In this paper we present the design and use of a multi-touch surface that serves as a front-end for games designed to specifically support the decline in declarative and prospective memory. The selected games are a result of both user studies that identified a set of requirements for the design of the surface and previous research on this issue. The system can be potentially embedded on the surface of a table. It comprises of a modified thin film transistor panel along with an acrylic surface. A video camera is used to capture the frustrated total internal reflection of fingers when these are subjected to infrared illuminators. Multi-touch functionality is achieved by a Kalman-based multiple target tracking algorithm that runs upon the feed of the camera and detects any number of fingers and their movement. Results indicate that users perceive the experience as a positive and functional process.},

  title = {{{SmiWork}}: {{An}} Interactive Smart Mirror Platform for Workplace Health Promotion},
  shorttitle = {{{SmiWork}}},
  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a multi-user smart mirror system conceived to promote wellness and healthier lifestyles in the work environment through persuasive strategies. By means of a RFID reader, the interactive mirror recognises different users through their personal corporate ID card, which allows them to have access to their personalised user-interface. The smart mirror provides workplace's indoor environmental conditions (thermal, humidity and light), personal physical exercise data obtained from wearable devices and general purpose information (e.g. weather and daily news). Additionally, motivational advice related to physical performance is supplied through request by applying speech-based recognition techniques. End-users can also inquire the mirror about their ranking position in a fair-daily competition that gives social recognition to the most-active-user. The implemented mirror has been evaluated in a one-week study conducted in the wild in the workplace premises. The quantitative data gathered throughout the study, as well as the qualitative users' feedback obtained in a post-trial focus group, provided promising findings for the acceptance and convenience of such a persuasive device in the work environment. Furthermore, valuable design-insights were obtained for future iterations of the smart mirror that encourages workers towards healthier lifestyles.},
