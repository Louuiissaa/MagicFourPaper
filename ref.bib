Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Furthermore, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of machine learning verified by these experiments are, of course, applicable to many other situations.},

Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping, rotating, and flipping input images. We artificially constrain our access to data to a small subset of the ImageNet dataset, and compare each data augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data augmentations strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also experiment with GANs to generate images of different styles. Finally, we propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations that best improve the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of this method on various datasets.},

Two approaches for creating additional training samples are data warping, which generates additional samples through transformations applied in the data-space, and synthetic over-sampling, which creates additional samples in feature-space. We experimentally evaluate the benefits of data augmentation for a convolutional backpropagation-trained neural network, a convolutional support vector machine and a convolutional extreme learning machine classifier, using the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We found that while it is possible to perform generic augmentation in feature-space, if plausible transforms for the data are known then augmentation in data-space provides a greater benefit for improving performance and reducing overfitting.},

Experimental results on two datasets validate the efficiency of our MCAE model and our methodology of generating synthetic data.},

  isbn = {978-0-444-81862-1},
  abstract = {Prototypes are widely recognized to be a core means of exploring and expressing designs for interactive computer artifacts. Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use. Current terminology for describing prototypes centers on attributes of prototypes themselves that can be distracting. Tools can be used in many different ways, and detail is not a sure indicator of completion. This chapter proposes a change in the language used to talk about prototypes, to focus more on fundamental questions about the interactive system being designed. The goal of this chapter is to establish a model that describes any prototype in terms of the artifact being designed rather than the prototype's incidental attributes. By focusing on the purpose of the prototype\textemdash{}that is, what it prototypes\textemdash{}better decisions can be made about the kinds of prototypes to build. With a clear purpose for each prototype, prototypes can be better used to think and communicate about design. This chapter begins by describing current difficulties in communicating about prototypes: the complexity of interactive systems; issues of multi-disciplinary teamwork; and the audiences of prototypes. The chapter introduces the model and illustrates it with some initial examples of prototypes from real projects. The chapter concludes with a summary of the main implications of the model for prototyping practice.},
